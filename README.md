# WebQrCodeGenerator
An online QrCode generator

# Motivation

All QrCode generators online that i ran across, were either not free, or did ask for some sort of registration. Maybe it's just my personal UX. So i've decided to build my own online QrCode generator using Flask.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vladimirevmenoff/WebQrCodeGenerator
```
